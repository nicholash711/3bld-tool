# 3BLD Memo Tool

## About 3BLD

3BLD, AKA 3x3 Blind, is an event in speed cubing competitions such that competitors
must solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube blindfolded. When the timer starts, competitors
are allowed to inspect the cube, known as the `memorization phase`, then is 
immediately followed by solving the cube with a blindfold on, known as the the 
`execution phase`. 

One of the main problems of this event is large amount of memorization required
and being able to memorize the cube in a timely manner. 

## How Memorization Works

Corner and edge pieces are memorized separately, and each part gets a letter label
from A to X. Most labeling schemes follow something like this:

<sub> Some lettering schemes go from the up to left face instead of up to front.</sub>

## The Tool

This tool is designed to help people practice memorization and reduce overall times.

## TODO

- make different tabs
    - letter pairing grid to add words
    - practice tab to do memo
    - tab to practice naming corner / edge lettering
- add functionality to change preferred orientation of cube
- add functionality to change preferred lettering of pieces.
- ? make practice tab adjust to what the person needs ?
